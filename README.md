# LSST Data Management Documents

Meta repository for all LSST Data Management documents developed on Github.
The repository is primarily configured to use Git submodules to refer to individual git repositories for each document using the provided hierarchy.
It is not expected that document files will be committed directly to this repository.

To check out a full document tree clone the repository and then initialize the submodules:

```
git clone https://github.com/lsst-dm/dm-docs.git
cd dm-docs
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

The `init`/`update` has to happen to pick up new submodules as new documents are added (this can be noted by pulling and seeing that `.gitmodules` has changed but there is now harm in redoing the `git submodule` commands).
Updates to old documents just need `git pull`.

The primary resource for baselined LSST Data Management documents is [LSST DocuShare](https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-12).
