# LSST Data Management Documents

Meta repository for all LSST Data Management documents developed on Github.
The repository is primarily configured to use Git submodules to refer to individual git repositories for each document using the provided hierarchy.
It is not expected that document files will be committed directly to this repository.

The primary resource for baselined LSST Data Management documents is [LSST DocuShare](https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-12).
