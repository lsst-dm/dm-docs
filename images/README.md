#images 

images for inclusion in latex documents (or anyplace else). The idea is there is one master copy of any image/org chart etc .. which is used in all docs rather than copies ending up in many different repos .. well we can try right ?. 


You should have this in the root of dm-docs - other docs will sym link to it as images.
